TEI2002.pdf  is the presentaiton I made at the annual meeting of the TEI.

This folder contains all of the test data and the code and the notes I made during the process.

I haven't touched this since the conference.  It looks like the bin folder contains the final XSLT scripts and the samples folder contains the sample data I was testing it with.

The .bat files are DOS batch scripts that call Microsoft's msxml.exe engine to run the XSLT engine.
