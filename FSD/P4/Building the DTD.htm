<P>Start with <TT>teifs2.dtd</TT> and try to convert it to a clean DTD in XML
Spy. What does it take?</P>

<P>The make a plain DTD for FSD:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Start with <TT>teifsd2.dtd</TT>.</LI>
<LI>Not clear how much it pulls in. First added header, core, and linking, and
it still had undefined elements.</LI>
<LI>Changed &lt;teiHeader&gt; to #PCDATA and it still had undefined elements.
</LI>
<LI>Changing %paraContent to #PCDATA in <TT>teiclas2.ent</TT> finally did it.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>%paraContent is used by fsDesscr and fDescr.</P>
